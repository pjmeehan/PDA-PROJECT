    "1. Choose a real world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one hundred data points across at least four different variables.\n",
    "2. Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.\n",
    "3. Synthesise/simulte a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.\n",
    "4. Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter mnotebook - the data itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook."
