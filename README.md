# FDA-PROJECT
Fundamentals of Data Analysis Project <br>

## To run the code, just start from the first Jupyter cell and continue to click the RUN button.

There seems to be a lot to this project so I want to try to break it down into many small projects that I will be able to tie together in the end.

Here are the small projects :

1. Choose phenomenon - I want to choose something that I am intereted. Initially I'm thinking of my favourite National Hockey League team, the New York Rangers. The Rangers are currently going through a rebuild and I was wondering what does it take for a team to win in the NHL. I would like to see the results of what it takes to win and see if the Rangers are heading in the right direction or might they need something(new player, new offensive strategy, new defensive strategy etc) to help them get there. So, I plan to look at a team that has had success at winning the last couple of years and pick some variables that I think might be related to winning. I will look at the Tampa Bay Lightning fron the National Hockey League (NHL) because they have had a very successful few years recently and currently have the most wins in the league this year. The Lightning were one on the NHL teams to use data analytics to help them make decisions and that seems to be working. I'll take a look into that and provide some information.

2. Pick my variables - What does it take to win in the NHL? Certainly my most important variable will be result of the game, win or loss. I think important variables to go along with result are goals against, goals for and maybe save percentage or power play goals or penalties taken. I'd like to be able to see if say a team scores 3 goals, what are the chances they will win or if a team's goalie has a high save percentage what chances are there of winning the game. I will look at what some other NHL fans, researchers and personnel are looking at and choose my variables around that.

3. Investigate my variables - give definition of each, maybe compare to league average or historical averages, historical high/low. How do these variables relate to the last few Stanley Cup winners? Compare last years final stats with how successful the teams were.

4. Find real life data set -  https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/TBL/2018_gamelog.html should contain the info I need. Make sure there is at least 100 data points. I will base my data set on the win & losses of the Tampa Bay Lightning based on the start of the 2017/18 season which will give me more than 100 data points. I'm choosing the Lightning because thay had the most wins last season and have the most wins this current season.


5. What are the distributions of my variables? Find out how to test for distribution and document it. I will use histograms to quickly identify the shape of my distribution and decide what distributions I will apply to my data set.

6. Choose which numpy random() functions I will need to use to create individual data sets based on my four variables.

7. Construct a model (algorithm) to create my random data set. This will be done by creating an algorithm by combining all the individual data sets into one 'master' data set.

8. I will then use the describe() function on the real data set vs my random data set and compare the results to see if my random data set is a good match to the real data set.

9. How are my variables related to each other. Use correlation to determine and document it.

10. Document all the above in a Jupyter notebook.

11. give directions on how to run the code.

12. give details of references.
