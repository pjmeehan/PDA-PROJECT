Fundamentals of Data Analysis Project
There seems to be a lot to this project so I want to try to make it into many small projects that I will be able to tie together in the end.
Here are the small projects :
1. Choose phenomenon - I want to something that I am intereted in so it will contain my interest throughout the whole project. Initially I'm thinking of my favourite National Hockey League team, the New York Rangers. The Rangers are currently going through a rebuild and I was wondering what does it take for a team to win in the NHL. I would like to see the results of what it takes to win and see if the Rangers are heading in the right direction or might they need something(new player, new offensive strategy, new defensive strategy etc) to help them get there.
2. Pick my variables - What does it take to win in the NHL? Certainly my most important variable will be result of the game, win or loss. I think important variables to go along with result are goals against, goals for and maybe save percentage or power play goals or penalties taken. I'd like to be able to see if say a team scores 3 goals, what are the chances they will win or if a team's goalie has a high save percentage what chances are there of winning the game.
3. Find real life data set -  https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/tampa-bay-lightning-team-game-log?season=201 should contain the info I need. Make sure there is atleast 100 data points. I will base my data set on the win losses of the Tampa Bay Lightning based on the start of the 2017/18 season which will give me more than 100 data points. I'm choosing the Lightning because thay had the most wins last season and have the most wins this current season.
4. Investigate my variables - give definition of each, maybe compare to league average or historical averages, historical high/low. How do these variables relate to the last few Stanley Cup winners? I need more....
5. What are the distributions of my variables? Find out how to test for distribution and document it.
6. How are my variables related to each other. Use correlation to determine and document it.
7. synthesise the data to closely match real data. figure out how to do this with code.
8. detail all reasearch
9. implement the simulation in Jupyter notebook with data set displayed in cell.
10. give directions on how to run.
